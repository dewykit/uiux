	<h6>Overview</h6>
	<p>
	Re-imagining Google Home personalised to a specific house, the Bipolar House, in line to the design principal and the way of living promoted by the physical boundaries of architecture.<br><br>
		The Bipolar House has two modes of cluster and non-cluster/concealment and reveal. The mode of concealment attempts to erase all evidence of the living. 
		The forensic nature of the house forces a users to closely inspect the details of the house for the house to slowly unravel itself. 
		Over time, for any user, the relationship to the house/owner will affect how much of the house is allowed for exploration. As an act of social-filter.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<h6>Problem Statement</h6>
		<p>There were no automation system providing a comprehensive solution for ensuring a comfortable living environment. Although, the house was designed in a way to maximise the solar movement and wind direction, <mark>a static design cannot support personalised needs. There required for some control mechanism for the people living and visiting the house. Specifically in regards to lighting, water temperature, air conditioning and air purity.</mark> A home assistance application is needed to address the issue, allowing users to easily control and monitor these factors in order to create a comfortable and healthy living space.</p>

	- Limited options for customisation and personalisation.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Typical Scenario</b></p>
	<p>I tend to cope well with high temperature during summer but I can't deal with high humidity. I need an assistant system that can be personalised for my needs. Sometimes I have people over and I would like to set different lighting depending on the occasion.<br></p>

		<h6>Site Overview</h6>

		
		<p>As an open floor plan, there are no physical boundaries separating the programs. 
		The house offers two definite served and servant spaces to assist in creating programs and rituals that support the living. 
		The servant spaces - toilets, storage, technical rooms, duct shaft and kitchen uses the momentum created by a single levelled line across the span of the house to protect the services. 
		The servant areas meant for inhibition allows for all the material, object and occupancy. </p>

		<h6>Service Blueprint</h6>
		<br>
		<img src="images/My home/Service blueprint.svg" alt="Service blueprint">
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>The unique linear design of the house has one set of sequence of movement allowed within the space, different to a typical housing typology we are used to. This sets the user journey also linear and has a definitive chorography to a user's movement. In the service blueprint, identified moments of user interaction with the system installed, as the touch points.</p>

		<h6>Identifying Opportunities</h6>

		<br>
		<p>User experience infographics in relation to macro and micro time, usage and projected density of movement. As well as series of programs and rationale for the composition of the house, illustrating the nature of the house with bent corners for added privacy.</p>

		<img src="images/My home/Mind map.svg" class="img-responsive" alt="Mind map">
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>Through the brainstorming exercise, several key factors were identified, including home maintenance, home surveillance, solar access, environmental factors, and home systems. These points revealed overlaps in the system, such as the need for movable mechanical louvres for both improvement in the home surveillance and for solar access.</p>

		<h6>Information Architecture</h6>
		<br>
		<img src="images/My home/Information architecture.svg" alt="Service blueprint">
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>The system uses a set of patterns for each house feature to ensure ease and precision of control. Multiple nodes are used to control a single element, providing the user with maximum flexibility and control as well as the ability to save their favourite settings or simply using the premade settings. To minimise confusion when using the interface, the interface needs to have clear and distinct characteristics designed for each feature set included in the system.</p>

		<br clear=left>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>To create a screen requirement set for the next user interface design stage, a study of a number of featuress needed at each touchpoint, compared to market standard for those products was conducted. The information architecture should work with these requirements to develop an interface design brief.</p>

	<h6>Reflection Statement</h6><br>
	<p>The development of a home assistance application for a unique house with it's own design integrity was a challenging project. As a UI/UX designer for this application, it was important to <mark>consider the specific needs and the physical boundaries of this type of living.</mark><br><br>
	The application's ability to integrate with multiple systems and provide remote control, while also complementing the design principles of the way of living in the house has been a key factor in its success.
	</p>
	
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>Key Takeaways</h3><br>
	<p>•&emsp;Creating side-by-side comparisons to create two different stream of thinking to create a project;<br>
	•&emsp;Understanding the user's needs and the site specifically where the application will be installed to;<br>
	•&emsp;Creating set parameters before and identify requirements and to document in my own style;<br>
	•&emsp;Ensure the design is accessible to provide an inclusive user experience;<br>
	•&emsp;Validate design decisions through iterations.
