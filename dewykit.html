	<h6 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Overview</h6>
	<p>Dewy is a small Australian online commerce website that specialises in providing Australians with a diverse selection of high-quality Korean skincare products. The website makes it easy for customers to access these products, which is difficult to get delivered to Australia and general Oceania region. Dewy is committed to offering these products at affordable prices, making them accessible to a wider range of customers.</p>
	
	<h6 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Problem Statement</h6>
	<p>There is a lack of accessibility to Korean skin products in Australia due to the unavailability of physical stores and a centralised online platform for shopping. As a results, customers may have to rely on unreliable and overpaid third-party sellers, making it difficult for them to obtain these products at a reasonable cost.</p>

	<h6 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Solution</h6>
	<p>A centralised online platform to purchase Korean skincare products from brands that are hard-to-get-by in Australia. By establishing partnerships with Korean manufactures/distributors, this ensures the products are authentic and reasonably priced and the site would provide a cost-effective solution to the problem of accessibility.</p>

		<h6>Identifying User Typology</h6>
		<p>The team at Dewy has identified that <mark>skincare can be overwhelming for those who are new to it, or a luxury to those super busy as it requires a significant amount of time and effort to research and purchase the appropriate products</mark> for one’s specific skin types and needs. Additionally, the sheer amount of information and skincare hacks online can be confusing and make it difficult to determine the best products for the individual’s skin type and needs. In addition to the effort required to find the right skincare products, there have been reports of hazardous ingredients in some products, making it difficult for the general public to identify which products are safe to use. This adds an extra layer of concern for those who are looking to start a skincare routine or switch to new products. 
		<br>
		<br>
	</div>

	<div class="column">
		<h6>Identifying Business Market</h6>
		<p>To address the problem identified, the team at Dewy developed <mark>a subscription base service that delivers customised boxes with 7 different sheet masks to the customer’s door each month.</mark> The service includes a self-diagnosis system in the form of a quiz to help customers determine their skin type and ensure they receive the most appropriate products. This way, the customers can enjoy trying new products each month without having to spend time researching and purchasing them individually.</p>

	<h6>Dewy's business market position</h6>
	<p>Dewy takes a business position learning from the Facetory's model. Dewy targets customers in Australia and New Zealand by focusing on marketing through social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. While Korean beauty brands Innisfree and Tony Moly have already entered the Australian market, <mark>Dewy believes that the market is still not saturated and sees an opportunity to establish a presence in the region.</mark></p>

	<p><b>Fitts's Law</b></p>
	<img src="images/Fitts law.svg" alt="Fitts's Law">
	<br><br>
	<p>The smaller your target area is, the longer it takes the user to perform that action based on the distance/size ratio.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="column">
	<p><b>Millers's Law</b></p>
	<img src="images/Millers law.svg" alt="Miller's Law">
	<p>Display information in chunks, this way it is manageable to users to remember what they consumed.</p>

	<p><b>Von Restorff Effect</b></p>
	<img src="images/Von Restorff Effect.svg" alt="Von Restorff Effect">
	<br><br>
	<p>Highlight elements like Call to Action (CTA) to stand out from the rest of the design, it's easily noticeable by user.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="column">
	<p><b>Jakob's Law</b></p>
	<img src="images/Jakobs Law.svg" alt="Jackob's Law">
	<br><br>
	<p>For instance think how Amazon, myntra and most of the ecommerce sites behave. They follow similar patterns, similar checkout processes most of the models are almost same. This way the user will focus on their task rather than learning new models.</p>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>Using multicolumn grid, using regulated spacing system create distinctive categorised features of the website, showing the hero image/information as the initial focal point, the vector line leads the eye down to the action button and more information about the brand/products.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Mobile Resolutions</b></p>
	<br>
	<img src="images/UI Grid mobile.svg" class="img-responsive" alt="UI systems">
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>Studying the relationship between the user's thumb and the ease of accessibility of the screen is studied. Whilst there are other methods of holding a mobile device, this particular style is the most commonly used with compromises in the 'thumb zone'. Area is highlighted for optimal placing for any action or directory buttons.</p>
	<br>
	<h6>High Fidelity Mock-up</h6>
	<br>
	<img src="images/UI Grid 3 - hifi mobile.svg" class="img-responsive" alt="Mock-up">
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>The accessibility study shown previously of the thumb zone was used to locate action buttons and used grids to ensure the consistency in the UI, as well as to establish a clear hierarchy throughout the page.</p>
	<br>
	<div class="column">
	<h6>Reflection</h6><br>
	<p>In reflection on the Dewy project, I learned the importance of understanding the user and their needs. Through conducting the user research, I was able to gain valuable insight into the target audience's pain points and preferences. This helped inform my design decisions and ensured that the final product was user-centered. Additionally, iterating and validating my designs through prototyping and testing allowed me to gather feedback and make improvements to the user experience.<br>
	<br>I realised the importance of usability in creating the navigation intuitive ensuring that all aspect of the product are taken into consideration. One of the most important takeaways from this project was that focusing on the <mark>user and their needs has a direct correlation with sales rate. By understanding the target audience and designing a user-centered product, it will lead to increased satisfaction and a likelihood of them making a purchase. </mark>

	<h6>Key Takeaways</h6><br>
	<p>•&emsp;Conduct thorough user research to gain insight into the target audience's needs, wants and pain points, to inform the design decisions to ensure the final product is user-centered.<br>
	•&emsp;Use prototyping and testing to validate design decisions and gather feedback.<br>
	•&emsp;Continously gather feedback and use it to imporve the product even after the product has been launched.<br>
